# Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection using multivariate gaussian distribution in R. Performed feature analysis and created polynomial (quadratic) features to capture any correlation between the features. Data is divided into train/cross validation/test sets composed of 60/20/20 percent of the overall data and 0/50/50 percent of anamolous examples respectively. Cross Validation set is used to find the best epsilon so that p(x) < epsilon for an anomalous example and p(x) >= epsilon for normal example where p(x) is the independence assumption on the values of the features for a given example.
